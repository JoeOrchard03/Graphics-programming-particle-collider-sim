Plan for worksheet 3 and artefact:

I want to make a effect that simulates particles such as sand/dust hitting a piece of glass and then after a few seconds or on a button press wiping them away to simulate them being blown off or swiped away.

For a very basic implementation of my artefact I want to have a see through plane stationary in space, create small cubes to represent particles and have the cubes move towards the plane over time, when they hit the plane they should stop, after a button press they should disappear or after a few seconds of hitting the plane they should disappear.

Moving forward to refine my artefact I want to look into the particle simulation to change the cubes into more realistic particles, also want to change the texture of the glass pane and particles to create a more realistic simulation.
