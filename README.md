Please see Comp 305 poster.pdf to view the academic poster I made for this project which explains it in more detail.

This project utilizes openGL and C++, it was made to simulate particles of dust or sand hitting glass and then fading away. To do this I loaded various amounts of small boxes to represent the particles and had them move towards the bigger box which I made transparent to resemble a glass pane, for each box I performed an AABB collision test to detect when they hit the glass. I then stopped them moving to simulate them hitting the glass and deleted them after a few seconds to simulate them fading away.
